Contributing Guidelines
============
All the guidelines for contributing to MobArena will be found in this file.

Formatting
==========

* Use the allman style.

* Ensure your formatting is good and like all other code in the source, we want our code to be clean :)

Commiting + Making Changes
==========================

* If you have too many commits, squash them into one please. It would be appreciated if there was only one commit.

* Test your changes.

* Ensure there aren't any errors or warnings in your code, if there are warnings please ensure there won't be an NPE and use @SuppressWarnings to ensure the warning isn't showing up.

* Your main commit (first commit in your pull request) should be Bukkit-styled; here is an example:

Implement /gtfo to ban players; Adds (suggestion thread, if you made one, if you didn't just don't put this here but a suggestion thread is always recommended).
