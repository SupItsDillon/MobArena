Contributing Guidelines
============
All the guidelines for contributing to MobArena will be found in this file.

Formatting
==========

* Use the allman style.

* Ensure your formatting is good and like all other code in the source, we want our code to be clean :)

Commiting + Making Changes
==========================

* If you have too many commits, squash them into one please. It would be appreciated if there was only one commit.

* Test your changes.

* Ensure there aren't any errors or warnings in your code, if there are warnings please ensure there won't be an NPE and use @SuppressWarnings to ensure the warning isn't showing up.

* Feel free to update MobArena.jar in the dist folder, if you wish to compile your pull request. However, you must use Netbeans to compile MobArena.

* Your main commit (first commit in your pull request) should be Bukkit-styled; here is an example:

Implement /gtfo to ban players; Adds (suggestion thread, if you made one, if you didn't just don't put this here but a suggestion thread is always recommended).

* Include justification and a breakdown of the pull request in the description - if you have a suggestion thread, then link to it aswell. Also, if your pull request includes a compiled copy (in the dist folder), then you must say whether you compiled it with Netbeans or not. Usually, you will HAVE to use Netbeans to compile.
